# Multithreaded Web Crawler

A high-performance multithreaded web crawler built in C using POSIX threads. The crawler starts from a seed URL, downloads web pages concurrently, extracts links, and analyzes page content.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Multithreading and concurrency
- Thread synchronization using mutex locks
- Systems programming in C
- Performance-focused design
- Collaborative software development

## My Contributions
- Built the logging system to track crawler activity  
- Implemented a thread-safe URL queue  
- Added synchronization to protect shared resources  
- Helped improve stability during concurrent execution  

## Technologies
- C
- POSIX Threads (pthreads)
- Mutex Locks
- Makefile

## Team
This project was developed collaboratively with other engineers as part of a systems programming project.
